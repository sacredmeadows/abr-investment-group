# ABR Investment Group — Website

Minimal, production-ready Vite + React + Tailwind site.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` — local dev server
- `npm run build` — production build to `dist`
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build locally

## Netlify Forms
Forms are configured for Netlify and include static hidden forms in `index.html` so Netlify can detect them during build.
